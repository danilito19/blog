I was the only kid in statistics class to drool over the material. By the end of my International Political Economy degree, I realized that using data analysis and statistics in government and NGOs could help answer many of our most important social problems. While I have plenty of experience with public policy, international relations, economics, and academic research, I am still learning about data science tools. I started with STATA, SQL, then Python, R, and worked on anything that was put in front of me - including some design with Sketch 3 and iOS development with Swift. My goal is to continue learning through a graduate degree, personal projects, and contributions to open-source projects that can improve the public sector through data. Currently, I'm a candidate for the [Master in Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp-sites.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy.





## When I am not thinking about data, I:

* Freelance as a Spanish-English translator
* Browse Reddit
* Hunt for [cheap flights](https://skiplagged.com)
* Weightlift, do yoga, run, and tackle my fitness goals
* Cook restaurant-style meals at home with my husband
* Read about financial independence
* Ponder about remote work and plan a future as a digital nomad
